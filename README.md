# AI Technical Writing Portfolio — Shipra Jain

I am a Senior Technical Writer with 7+ years of experience documenting AI-powered products, including chatbots, voice-based systems, APIs, and enterprise platforms.

My work sits at the intersection of:
- Artificial Intelligence & NLU
- Conversational AI (chatbots and voice bots)
- API & developer documentation
- Enterprise SaaS platforms

I have worked end-to-end on multiple AI products — from early-stage feature definition to production releases — collaborating closely with product managers, engineers, UX, and support teams.

This repository contains curated writing samples that demonstrate:
- Clear, user-focused AI documentation
- API and integration guides
- Conversational AI setup and configuration docs
- Content designed for both humans and AI systems
