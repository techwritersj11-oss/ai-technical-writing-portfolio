# How I Think About AI Documentation

AI documentation is not traditional product documentation with new terminology added.

It requires a different mindset.

Over time, I’ve developed a few core principles that guide how I approach documenting AI systems.

---

## 1. Document Behavior, Not Just Features

Traditional documentation explains:
- What the system does
- How to configure it
- How to integrate it

AI documentation must also explain:
- How the system *behaves*
- What influences its output
- Where variability exists
- What it may get wrong

AI systems are probabilistic, not deterministic.  
Users need to understand that responses can vary based on input phrasing, context, and system configuration.

---

## 2. Make Uncertainty Explicit

AI systems can:
- Hallucinate
- Be overconfident
- Omit edge cases
- Misinterpret ambiguous prompts

Good AI documentation does not hide this.

It explains:
- Known limitations
- Validation requirements
- Confidence considerations
- Appropriate human oversight

Transparency builds trust.

---

## 3. Design for Prompt Literacy

AI systems shift responsibility from configuration to communication.

That means documentation must teach users:
- How to write better prompts
- How to refine requests
- How to evaluate output quality
- How to iterate

In AI documentation, prompting guidance is not optional — it is foundational.

---

## 4. Include Evaluation and Safeguards

AI documentation should include:

- Example prompts
- Expected outputs
- Failure cases
- Safe fallback patterns
- Escalation workflows

Users need to know what “good” looks like — and what “wrong” looks like.

---

## 5. Clarify the Role of Human Oversight

AI should be positioned as:

- A collaborator
- A drafting assistant
- An accelerator

Not:
- A decision-maker
- A compliance authority
- A guaranteed source of truth

Documentation must clearly define where human validation is required.

---

## 6. Write for Multiple Audiences

AI systems often serve:

- End users
- Developers
- Business stakeholders
- Governance and compliance teams

Effective AI documentation adapts:
- Tone
- Depth
- Examples
- Risk framing

Without losing clarity.

---

## 7. Treat Responsible AI as Part of Documentation

Responsible AI is not a marketing statement.

Documentation should cover:

- Data handling practices
- Security boundaries
- Model limitations
- Refusal behavior
- Safe fallback mechanisms

Clarity around these topics reduces misuse and increases adoption confidence.

---

## 8. Optimize for AI-Assisted Retrieval

Modern documentation may be consumed by:

- Humans
- AI copilots
- Search systems
- Internal knowledge assistants

Structure matters.

Clear headings, consistent terminology, and modular examples improve both:
- Human readability
- Machine retrievability

---

## My Philosophy in One Line

AI documentation should reduce uncertainty, clarify responsibility, and enable safe, effective usage.

It is not about explaining the technology alone — it is about guiding interaction.
