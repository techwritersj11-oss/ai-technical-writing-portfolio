## Overview

This case study showcases my end-to-end documentation ownership across multiple AI-driven products at Cisco, following the acquisition of Armorblox. It highlights how I design, scale, and deliver documentation for complex AI systems—balancing user experience, technical accuracy, and enterprise requirements.

## Background

I joined Cisco on **August 1, 2023**, as part of the Armorblox acquisition (July 2023). Armorblox was an AI-powered cybersecurity company focused on protecting email and cloud office applications from phishing and business email compromise using natural language understanding (NLU).

At Cisco, I worked as a Technical Writer on AI platforms, collaborating closely with product managers, engineers, UX teams, and developer advocacy.

## Core Strengths

* AI and NLU documentation (chatbots, assistants, APIs)
* UX-minded technical writing
* End-to-end ownership from Alpha to GA
* Cross-product standardization and content reuse
* Single-sourcing and scalability

## Major Deliveries

### 1. AI Assistant for CDO and cDFMC

**Problem**: Cisco’s documentation ecosystem is vast and fragmented, making it difficult for users to find accurate answers quickly.

**Solution**: Contributed to the AI Assistant for Security documentation, designed to surface relevant answers efficiently across products.

**Scope**:

* Alpha to GA documentation
* User guides and API documentation
* Information architecture alignment

**Outcome**:

* First major delivery at Cisco
* Improved findability and navigation across security documentation

### 3. AI Defense

**Customer Concern**: Security and trust in AI-driven systems

**Key Challenges**:

* User data protection
* Legal and compliance clarity
* Lack of content standardization

**My Role**:

* Delivered documentation from Alpha to GA
* Authored AI Defense API documentation
* Established documentation standards
* Transitioned ownership post-GA
