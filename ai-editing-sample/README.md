# AI Editing & Quality Improvement Sample

## Overview

This sample demonstrates how I review and improve AI-generated or draft technical content to ensure clarity, accuracy, and usability.

The goal is to:
- Remove ambiguity
- Improve structure and readability
- Align content with user intent
- Maintain technical accuracy

## Example 1: Feature Description

### Before (Draft / AI-Generated)

The system allows users to submit requests after approval, which may take some time depending on the situation. Once approved, the request will be processed accordingly.

### Issues Identified
- Vague timeline ("some time", "depending on the situation")
- Passive voice
- Unclear approval criteria

### After (Edited by Human)

Users can submit requests only after approval is granted.  
Approval typically takes a few minutes, but may vary based on system load. Once approved, the system automatically processes the request.

## Example 2: Error Message Explanation

### Before (Draft / AI-Generated)

The payment failed due to a backend issue. Please try again later.

### Issues Identified
- Not actionable
- Lacks recovery guidance
- Vague technical reason

### After (Edited by Human)

The payment could not be processed due to a temporary system issue.  
Wait 30 minutes and retry the transaction. If the issue persists, contact support with your transaction ID.

## Example 3: Setup Instructions

### Before (Draft / AI-Generated)

To generate the report, complete the setup and take a few minutes to process.

### Issues Identified
- Grammatically incorrect
- Unclear sequence
- Missing subject

### After (Edited by Human)

Complete the setup process to generate the report.  
The system typically takes a few minutes to process the request before the report becomes available.
