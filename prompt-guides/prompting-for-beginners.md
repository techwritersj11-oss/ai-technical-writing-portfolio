# Prompting Guide for New AI Users  
*A Practical Guide to Getting Better Results from AI Systems*

---

## Overview

This guide is designed for users who are new to working with AI systems such as chatbots, assistants, or generative tools.

It explains:
- How to write effective prompts
- Common mistakes to avoid
- How to improve AI responses through iteration
- What AI can and cannot reliably do

The goal is to help users communicate clearly with AI systems and get useful, trustworthy results.

## What Is a Prompt?

A **prompt** is the instruction or question you give an AI system.

Good prompts provide:
- Context
- Clear intent
- Specific expectations

Poor prompts are vague, incomplete, or assume the AI understands unstated details.

---

## DOs: How to Write Effective Prompts

### ✅ Be Clear About Your Goal
State what you want the AI to do.

**Good example**  
> Summarize this document in 5 bullet points for a non-technical audience.

**Poor example**  
> Explain this.

---

### ✅ Provide Context
AI performs better when it understands the situation.

**Example**  
> I’m a new user trying to configure a chatbot for customer support. Explain intents in simple terms.

---

### ✅ Specify the Format You Want
Tell the AI how you want the output structured.

**Examples**
- Bullet points  
- Step-by-step instructions  
- Short paragraph  
- Table  

---

### ✅ Break Complex Tasks Into Steps
If your request is large, split it into smaller prompts.

**Instead of**  
> Create full API documentation.

**Try**
1. Explain what the API does  
2. Describe authentication  
3. Provide a sample request and response  

---

### ✅ Review and Refine
AI output improves with feedback.

**Example**
> Rewrite this to be clearer and more user-friendly.

---

## DON’Ts: Common Prompting Mistakes

### ❌ Don’t Be Vague
AI cannot read your mind.

**Avoid**
> Fix this.  
> Make it better.

---

### ❌ Don’t Assume the AI Knows Your System
AI does not automatically know:
- Your internal tools
- Your company rules
- Your product configurations

Always provide necessary details.

---

### ❌ Don’t Treat AI Output as Final
AI responses should be:
- Reviewed
- Verified
- Edited when needed

Especially for:
- Technical accuracy
- Security claims
- Compliance-related content

---

### ❌ Don’t Ask for Guaranteed or Absolute Answers
AI may generate confident but incorrect responses.

Avoid prompts that encourage:
- “Always”
- “Guaranteed”
- “Exact root cause” without data

---

## Important Criteria for Successful AI Interaction

When using AI, keep these principles in mind:

### 🔹 Accuracy Over Speed
Fast answers are useful, but correctness matters more.

### 🔹 Verify Critical Information
Always double-check:
- Security details
- Legal or compliance information
- Technical specifications

### 🔹 Use AI as a Collaborator, Not an Authority
AI is best used as:
- A drafting assistant
- A brainstorming partner
- A language refinement tool

Not as a final decision-maker.

---

## Example: Improving a Prompt

### Initial Prompt
> Write documentation for a chatbot.

### Improved Prompt
> Write a short user guide explaining how a business user can create a basic chatbot, including bot creation, intent setup, and testing. Use simple language and bullet points.

---

## When AI Works Best

AI performs well for:
- Drafting content
- Rewriting for clarity
- Summarizing information
- Generating examples
- Improving tone and structure

AI is less reliable for:
- Making factual claims without sources
- Diagnosing system failures
- Explaining undocumented features

---

## Final Tip

Think of prompting as **clear communication**, not programming.

The better you explain what you need, the better the AI can help.
