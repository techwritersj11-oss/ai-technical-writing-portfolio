# Prompt Templates (Copy–Paste Ready)

This section provides reusable prompt templates designed for common real-world use cases.  
Each template is structured to reduce ambiguity, improve output quality, and encourage safe, effective AI interaction.

These prompts are intentionally written for **non-AI experts** and **first-time AI users**.

---

## 1. General Task Prompt (Baseline)

Use this when you want the AI to perform a clear task with minimal risk.

### Template
You are an assistant helping with [TASK].

Context:
[Brief background information]

Goal:
[What you want to achieve]

Constraints:

Tone: [formal / neutral / friendly]

Length: [short / medium / detailed]

Audience: [who this is for]

Output format:
[bullet points / paragraph / table]

### Example Use Case
Writing internal documentation, summaries, or explanations.

---

## 2. Customer Support Response Prompt

Designed for chatbots or AI assistants responding to end users.

### Template
You are a customer support assistant.

User issue:
[Describe the problem]

Rules:

Be polite and empathetic

Do not assume the user is technical

Do not guess if information is missing

If unsure, ask a clarifying question

Provide:

A clear explanation

Step-by-step guidance if applicable

A safe fallback if the issue cannot be resolved

---

## 3. Draft → Review → Improve Prompt

Useful for content refinement instead of first-draft generation.

### Template
Review the following content:

[PASTE CONTENT]

Tasks:

Improve clarity and structure

Remove ambiguity

Ensure factual consistency

Maintain the original intent and tone

Do not add new information unless explicitly stated.

---

## 4. AI Output Validation Prompt

Helps users critically evaluate AI-generated content.

### Template
Evaluate the following AI-generated output:

[PASTE OUTPUT]

Check for:

Factual accuracy

Logical consistency

Missing assumptions

Overconfidence or hallucination

If issues are found:

Clearly list them

Suggest safer or corrected alternatives

---

## 5. Safe Fallback Prompt

Used when AI must avoid guessing or hallucinating.

### Template
If the requested information is uncertain or unavailable:

Clearly state the limitation

Do not fabricate details

Offer next steps or escalation options

Suggest how the user can provide more information

---

## 6. Prompt for Structured Output (JSON/Table)

Ideal for APIs, integrations, or automation workflows.

### Template
Respond only in the following format:

[DEFINE FORMAT — JSON / TABLE]

Rules:

Do not include explanations

Do not include additional fields

Use empty values if information is missing

---

## 7. Clarifying Prompt (When Input Is Vague)

Teaches the AI to pause instead of guessing.

### Template
If the request is ambiguous:

Ask up to 2 clarifying questions

Do not proceed until clarification is provided

Explain why clarification is needed

---

## 8. Compliance-Aware Prompt

Useful for regulated domains (finance, healthcare, enterprise AI).

### Template
Before responding:

Avoid legal, medical, or financial advice

Do not provide definitive judgments

Include a disclaimer if required

Encourage human verification where appropriate

---

## Key Prompting Principles Applied

All templates follow these principles:
- Explicit context
- Clear constraints
- Defined output expectations
- Built-in safety checks

These templates are meant to be **starting points**, not rigid rules.

---

## When to Use Prompt Templates

Prompt templates are most effective when:
- Consistency matters
- Multiple users interact with the same AI system
- Output quality must be predictable
- Risk of hallucination must be reduced

---

*These templates reflect practical prompting patterns used in conversational AI, developer tools, and enterprise AI systems.*
